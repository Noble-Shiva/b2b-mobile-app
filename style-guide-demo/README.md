- Platform-specific styling is handled through CSS
- Touch interactions are implemented with JavaScript

## Customization

To customize the demo:
1. Edit CSS variables in `:root` for light mode colors
2. Edit `[data-theme="dark"]` for dark mode colors
3. Modify spacing scale variables
4. Update typography variables
5. Add new components following the existing patterns

## Performance

The demo is optimized for performance:
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- CSS animations use hardware acceleration
- Efficient event handling
- Progressive enhancement approach
